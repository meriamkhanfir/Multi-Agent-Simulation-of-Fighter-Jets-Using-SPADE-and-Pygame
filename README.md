# Multi-Agent-Simulation-of-Fighter-Jets-Using-SPADE-and-Pygame
## 1. Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a multi-agent simulation of fighter jets using the SPADE library in Python for agent logic and communication, and Pygame for real-time visualization. This simulation will model behaviors such as patrolling, enemy detection, and communication between agents. The application will be designed with scalability and modularity in mind, allowing additional features and behaviors to be integrated in the future.

##  2. Objectives
Implement a multi-agent system where each fighter jet is represented as an autonomous agent.
#
Utilize SPADE to handle agent behaviors and inter-agent communication.
#
Integrate Pygame for real-time graphical visualization of the simulation.
#
Create a flexible and extensible architecture that supports adding new features, behaviors, and visualization improvements.
#
Implement basic agent behaviors: patrolling, detecting enemies, and communicating detections.
## 3. Technologies Used
SPADE: Python library for creating multi-agent systems using the XMPP protocol.
#
Pygame: Python library for game development and real-time visualization.
#
Python: Main programming language for developing the agents and visualization.
